## other random information
as of right now i'm probably done developing this, it's supposed to be simple and easy to use, so i don't want to over clutter it.  
however, if you run into any bugs or problems, please do leave an issue! i'll try my best to fix any problem you may have with this. ok bye have fun

## in development:
i've decided that i want to completely finish this repository and be able to archive it. [#7](https://github.com/carreb/tropical-webhook-cleanup/issues/7) will show all planned/in development features for v2. once v2 is released this project will be archived.  
this is put on hold for now
